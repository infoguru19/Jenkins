===============

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Here are some basics to get you started:

- Continuous Delivery (CD): Jenkins automates the deployment of code to production or staging environments after it passes automated tests.
