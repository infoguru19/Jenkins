# Jenkins
===============

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). Here are some basics to get you started:

## Key Concepts
==============
- Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): Jenkins automates the deployment of code to production or staging environments after it passes automated tests.

## Core Components
===================
- Jobs/Projects: The fundamental unit of work in Jenkins, which can be configured to perform various tasks like building code, running tests, and deploying applications.
- Pipelines: A series of automated steps defined in a Jenkinsfile, which can be written in either Declarative or Scripted syntax.
- Plugins: Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality, allowing integration with various tools and platforms.
  
## Basic Workflow
==================
1. **Install Jenkins**: You can install Jenkins on various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
2. **Create a Job**: Define a job to perform tasks like building code from a repository.
3. **Configure a Pipeline**: Use a Jenkinsfile to define a series of steps for building, testing, and deploying your application.
4. Run and Monitor Jobs: Execute jobs and monitor their progress through the Jenkins dashboard.

Declarative Pipeline Syntax
================================
- Declarative Pipeline is a more simplified and opinionated syntax. It uses a pipeline block to define the entire pipeline.

```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Scripted Pipeline Syntax
===========================
- Scripted Pipeline is a more flexible and powerful syntax, written in **Groovy**.
```
node {
    stage('Build') {
        echo 'Building...'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        echo 'Testing...'
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        echo 'Deploying...'
    }
}
```

Key Components
==================
- agent: Specifies where the pipeline or a specific stage will run.
- stages: Defines a sequence of stages to be executed.
- steps: Contains the actual tasks to be performed in each stage.
